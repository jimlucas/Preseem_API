Preseem API via PHP
===================

## Announcement Preseem API (June 2018)

I am happy to announce the release of the initial version of my Preseem API powered by PHP.

## Features


## Getting Started

This repo requires a webserver with PHP that has access to the internet.

To setup the configuration for the scripts to work correctly

  copy ./config/config.example.php ./config/config.local.php

The most important item that needs set is your Preseem API key.  Edit the new ./config/config.local.php and input your Preseem API key

## Contributing

I would love to get input from all developers out there.
